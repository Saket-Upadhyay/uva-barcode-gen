# Generate UVA Student ID Barcode

<sup>`Unaffiliated with the University of Virginia.`</sup>

## Motivation

I was tired of carrying my ID card to the Gym.
All we have to do is scan the barcode to register access and get locker room keys, you don't need anything else on ID card for that.

Even though you can generate the barcode from UVARec mobile app, you need to log-in using your NetBadge ID,
EVERY-SINGLE-TIME to
do so, which makes me look stupid, standing in line fiddling with my phone.

This is a simple weekend project to generate the barcode for any student ID number, and create a one-step shortcut in
your phone.

Just Click - Scan - Go.

This is now a one-tap solution on my phone's home screen.

#### What you can do :white_check_mark: :
All barcode dependent "check-in" activities - 
  * UVA Rec. Access,
  * In-house conference attendance,
  * Event check-in,
  * etc.
  
#### What you can't do :x: :
Everything else:
  * Anything that needs NFC capability of your ID Card. (Payment, Building Access, etc.)
